# playground-purescript-react-basic

I blocked a few days to learn [lumihq/purescript-react-basic](https://github.com/lumihq/purescript-react-basic).

I made a few components to explore some things I do really often with React in JS :

- Inputs and Buttons
- Timers
- Network requests + parse JSON
- Rendering lists

It was a really pleasant experience !

Next step : try [spicydonuts/purescript-react-basic-hooks](https://github.com/spicydonuts/purescript-react-basic-hooks) and [dwhitney/purescript-react-basic-native](https://github.com/dwhitney/purescript-react-basic-native)

## Install

Install project dependencies

```
> yarn install
```

Build PureScript project

```
> yarn build
```

## Run

Start dev server

```
> yarn start
```

To use hot-reload, you need to use `purs ide` with your editor so that it recompiles your PureScript code on save :

- Plugin for VScode : [https://github.com/nwolverson/vscode-ide-purescript](https://github.com/nwolverson/vscode-ide-purescript)
- Plugin for Atom : [https://atom.io/packages/ide-purescript](https://atom.io/packages/ide-purescript)
